# üìä SaanjhiCreation Reporting System

## Overview
Comprehensive reporting and analytics system for the SaanjhiCreation online clothing rental platform. This system provides business intelligence, operational insights, and data-driven decision making capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Current Microservices with Reporting
- **ProductService** - Clothing items, categories, pricing + **Product & Inventory Reports**
- **CustomerService** - Customer profiles, addresses + **Customer Analytics Reports**
- **RentalService** - Rental transactions, bookings + **Rental & Revenue Reports**
- **CategoryService** - Product categorization + **Category Performance Reports**

#### **Frontend Dashboard Aggregator**
```typescript
// Angular 20 Frontend - Dashboard Service
src/
  app/
    features/
      dashboard/
        services/
          dashboard-aggregator.service.ts  // Combines data from all services
          product-reports.service.ts       // Calls ProductService reports
          rental-reports.service.ts        // Calls RentalService reports
          customer-reports.service.ts      // Calls CustomerService reports
        components/
          executive-dashboard/             // Combined cross-service view
          product-dashboard/               // ProductService reports
          rental-dashboard/                // RentalService reports
          customer-dashboard/              // CustomerService reports
```

#### **Key Features**
- **Domain-Driven Reports** - Each service owns its reporting logic

### Report Distribution by Service

#### **ProductService Reports**
```csharp
// Product Performance & Inventory Analytics
- Most/Least Rented Items
- Product Performance by Category
- Seasonal Trends Analysis
- Inventory Turnover Rates
- Size Distribution Analytics
- Damage/Return Rate by Product
- Pricing Optimization Reports
```

#### **RentalService Reports**
```csharp

// RentalService calls ProductService API for category data
// Dashboard Aggregator combines data from multiple services

// Example: Revenue by Product Category Report
1. RentalService gets rental revenue data
2. Calls ProductService API for product/category details
3. Combines data and returns comprehensive report
4. Frontend dashboard displays integrated view
```

#### **Real-time Updates**
```csharp
// Each service manages its own real-time updates
- ProductService: Inventory changes, new products
- RentalService: New bookings, returns, revenue updates
- CustomerService: New registrations, profile updates
- Dashboard Aggregator: Combines real-time streams
```

2. Angular 20 development environment
3. Each service has its own database for domain data

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# 1. Add reporting controllers to existing services
# ProductService
dotnet add Services/ProductService/ProductService.API package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
# Add ProductReportsController.cs

# RentalService  
dotnet add Services/RentalService/RentalService.API package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
# Add RentalReportsController.cs

# CustomerService
dotnet add Services/CustomerService/CustomerService.API package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
# Add CustomerReportsController.cs

# 2. Add reporting queries to Application layer
# Example for ProductService:
# GetProductPerformanceQuery, GetInventoryAnalyticsQuery

# 3. Set up Angular dashboard
ng generate module dashboard
ng generate component dashboard/executive-dashboard
ng generate component dashboard/product-analytics
ng generate component dashboard/rental-analytics
ng generate service dashboard/dashboard-aggregator
```

### **Service Extension Pattern**
```csharp
// Add to each service's Program.cs
builder.Services.AddSignalR();

// Add to each service's API layer
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductReportsController : ControllerBase
{
    // Service-specific reporting endpoints
}
```

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Choose starting service** - ProductService, RentalService, or CustomerService
2. **Implement first reporting endpoints** in the chosen service
3. **Create corresponding Angular dashboard components**
4. **Test service-specific reports** before moving to aggregation
5. **Build Dashboard Aggregator** for cross-service insights
6. **Implement real-time updates** and advanced features

### **Recommended Starting Order:**
1. **RentalService** - Revenue reports (most business critical)
2. **ProductService** - Inventory and product performance
3. **CustomerService** - Customer analytics and insights
4. **Dashboard Aggregation** - Executive overview combining all services

This distributed approach ensures better performance, maintainability, and follows domain-driven design principles while keeping each service focused on its own reporting responsibilities.
